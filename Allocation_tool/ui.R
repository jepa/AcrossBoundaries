However, when stock ranges shift, governance systems and boundaries are no longer aligned. This misalignment has already created conflicts around access and the re-distribution of benefits flowing from the stocks. This is a global challenge that is likely to increase as the effects of climate change intensify in the coming years. Specific problems that arise from the movement of stocks across jurisdictions include: overfishing; conflicts over access; unfairness to stakeholders who have borne the costs of resource stewardship but cannot capture the benefits due to stock movement; and high costs and conflicts associated with re-negotiating allocation, which is typically the most contentious aspect of fishery management.")
