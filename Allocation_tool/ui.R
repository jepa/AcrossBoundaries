                                    different jurisdictions around the world. Elinor Ostromâ€™s fundamental principles of common pool
                                    resource governance include a requirement for clear boundaries over resource units. 
                                    However, when stock ranges shift, governance systems and boundaries are no longer aligned. 
                                    This misalignment has already created conflicts around access and the re-distribution of benefits 
                                    flowing from the stocks. This is a global challenge that is likely to increase as the effects of 
                                    climate change intensify in the coming years. 
                                    
                                    Specific problems that arise from the movement of stocks across jurisdictions include: 
                                    overfishing; conflicts over access; unfairness to stakeholders who have borne the costs of resource 
                                    stewardship but cannot capture the benefits due to stock movement; and high costs and conflicts associated 
                                    with re-negotiating allocation, which is typically the most contentious aspect of fishery management."
