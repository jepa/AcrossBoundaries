# Project background

Climate change is driving shifts in fish stock distributions that will affect resource availability across different jurisdictions around the world. Elinor Ostromâ€™s fundamental principles of common pool resource governance include a requirement for clear boundaries over resource units. However, when stock ranges shift, governance systems and boundaries are no longer aligned. This misalignment has already created conflicts around access and the re-distribution of benefits flowing from the stocks. This is a global challenge that is likely to increase as the effects of climate change intensify in the coming years. Specific problems that arise from the movement of stocks across jurisdictions include: overfishing; conflicts over access; unfairness to stakeholders who have borne the costs of resource stewardship but cannot capture the benefits due to stock movement; and high costs and conflicts associated with re-negotiating allocation, which is typically the most contentious aspect of fishery management.

# Objective and research questions

The objective of this tool is to evaluate policy options for managing fish stocks that are shifting across management boundaries, and to assess the socio-economic benefits and tradeoffs of these options for two important fisheries in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic.

1. Would adaptive allocation have reduced fuel use and carbon emissions, had it been applied when black sea bass and summer flounder stocks started to shift?

2. Would adaptive allocation have a positive economic impact on these fisheries, had it been applied when black sea bass and summer flounder stocks started to shift?

3.	How can conflicts around allocation be reduced in the context of shifting stocks?

4.	Where else in the U.S. could this type of solution be applied to alleviate the challenges that arise when stocks shift?

# Repository structure

## Data

### Processed 

This folder contains the data directly generated by our analysis and can be used to replicate the results of the study as well as figures and tables. Please refer to the published paper for methods. It contains the following sub-folders and data:


- **Interpolation**, contains the interpolation of each species analyzed (`tif_Centropristis_striata.csv`, `tif_Paralichthys_dentatus.csv`, and `tif_Stenotomus_chrysops.csv`. All data follows the same structure:
  - *index*, a unique identifier for each grid cell
  - *year*, year of data from 2970 to 2019
  - *region*, survey region (opt. Northeast US Fall or Northeast US Spring)
  - spp, species (Opt. black sea bass, yellowtail flounder, scup)
  - lon, longitude in degrees
  - lat, latitude in degrees
  - value, interpolation value as CPUE
- **grid_fp**, contains the shapefile and .csv file of the fishing ports grid
- **grid_sw**, contains the shapefile and .csv file of the state waters grid
- `top_ports.csv`, This is the list of top ports of the study. In addition to the previous structure:
  - species_name, species (Opt. black sea bass, yellowtail flounder, scup)
  - port_name, name of fishing port where catch is landed
  - state_postal, Abbreviation of state name
  - year_ton, year landings in tonns
  - year_value, year value of landings in USD
  - tresh, treshold relative to the top catches
  - lon, longitude in degrees
  - lat, latitude in degrees

### Raw

This folder contains the raw data used to create the analysis for this project. Please refer to the original data sources for specifics on methods. It contains the following sub-folders:

- OceanAdapt, contains the bottom trawl data hosted and cleaned by [OceanAdapt](https://oceanadapt.rutgers.edu/) for each species analyzed (_Centropristis striata_, *Paralichthys dentatus*, and *Stenotomus chrysops)*. Please see *Pinsky, et al. 2013 doi: 10.1126/science.1239352* for further information. All data (`obs_Centropristis_striata.csv, obs_Paralichthys_dentatus.csv, obs_Stenotomus_chrysops.csv` ) follows the same structure:
  - *region*, survey region (opt. Northeast US Fall or Northeast US Spring)
  - haulid, a unique identifier for haul
  - year, yer haul was performed
  - spp, species scientific name
  - wtcpue, catch per unit of effort in wet tones
  - common, common species name
  - stratum, stratum of haul collected
  - stratumarea, area of strutum
  - lon, longitude in degrees
  - lat, latitude in degrees
  - depth, depth of haul in meters
